Sparrow MLPipes is a Python package that simplifies the interface for the Python DeepStream bindings.

# ~~Quick~~ Start Example

In order to use this package, you need to:

1. Install [DeepStream](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_Quickstart.html)
2. Install the [Python DeepStream bindings](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps)
3. `pip install -U sparrow-mlpipes`

The easiest way to do this is to clone this repo and open it with VS Code. Then you can use the **Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers** extension to open the folder inside a pre-defined [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). You may need to edit the [devcontainer.json](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) to suit your needs.

Then, take a look at the [examples](./examples/) to get a feel for how the package works.
